* Python3 samples to create a data file and then use the a HTTP Put or Push command to send the data file to the UFL REST endpoint.

##Getting Started

You will need a development/test PI System and the PI Connector for UFL (the samples were tested with version 1.0.0.41).
The scripts have been tested with Pyhon 3.5.1 and come in two versions:
* piuflput.py - uses the Python requests module (instal using: pip install requests or apt-get install python-requests)
* piuflput_urllib.py - uses only Python modules that are part of a standard install of Python3.
The file [PI Connector for UFL REST samples](PI Connector for UFL REST samples.pdf) provides additional details about the samples.
