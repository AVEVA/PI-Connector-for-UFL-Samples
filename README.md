# PI-Connector-for-UFL-Samples

These samples show how to get started with the PI Connector for UFL and in particular with how to use the connector's REST endpoint feature.

## Contents

* Python samples to create data files and "PUT" it to the UFL REST endpoint, which can be find in the Python directory.
* Generic sample ini files can be found in the INI directory.
* A example of a processing and XML file used in a SOAP request is in the SOAP directory, also an example of using Powershell to send data to the UFL rest endpoint.

## Getting Started

You will need a development/test PI System and the PI Connector for UFL (the samples were tested with version 1.0.0.41).
The UFL connector will automatically create tags and elements, thus care must be taken when using these examples against a production system.
