# PI-Connector-for-UFL-Samples

These samples show how to get started with the PI Connector for UFL.

## Contents

* [INI_FILE_EXAMPLES] Configuration (INI) examples for parsing different kinds of data
* [REST_DATA_SENDERS (REST SERVER)] Python/C#/PowerShell samples to create data files and "PUT" it to the UFL REST endpoint
* [COMPLETE_SOLUTIONS] End to end solutions for various types of devices or data providers.

## Getting Started

You will need a development/test PI System and the PI Connector for UFL (the samples were tested with version 1.3.0.106).
The UFL connector will automatically create tags, elements and event frames, thus care must be taken when using these examples against a production system.
