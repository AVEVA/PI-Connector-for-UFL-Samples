# Raspberry Pi

## Contents

* A pair of python scripts that read sensor data from a connected Sense Hat (https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/sense-hat/), then format and send that data as web requests to a PI Connector for UFL endpoint
* A pair of .desktop files that should be placed in the /home/pi/.config/autostart directory on your Raspberry Pi; these files will allow both the VNC server and Python data-collecting script to start automatically on boot
* A pair of .ini files that can be used by the PI Connector for UFL to parse messages sent from the Raspberry Pi
